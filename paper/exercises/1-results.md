# Instructions

Divide your team in 2 sub-teams: sub-team 1 will work on descriptive results, sub-team 2 on inferential results.

Dedicate 5 minutes to Part 1 and 3 minutes to Part 2.

## Part 1

### Sub-team 1

Imagine a visualization (table or plot) that you would use to summarize your **descriptive** results. Describe how it looks like and what it shows.

-   Sketch this visualization on a paper. Write a caption for it.

-   If you have time left, take a picture of your sketch with caption and over-write the file `figures/results-descriptive.png`
