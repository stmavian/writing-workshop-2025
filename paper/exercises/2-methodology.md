# Instructions

Divide your team in 2 sub-teams: sub-team 1 will work on data collection/variables, sub-team 2 on analytic methods.

Dedicate 10 minutes to Part 1 and 5 minutes to Part 2.

## Part 1

### Sub-team 1 - Data collection and variables

1.  What is one aspect of data collection or variable creation, in your project, that you think will be particularly important to describe? Why?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

2.  Can you think of a visualization that could support the discussion of this aspect in your methodology section? Describe it

YOUR ANSWER HERE

[Examples: diagram illustrating a complex sampling scheme; diagram illustrating the stages of the study; diagram illustrating how several variables were combined into one; etc.]

### Sub-team 2 - Analytic methods

Focus on your main statistical analysis.

-   Write down a formula to explain the main analysis you currently plan to do

$$ logit(1(RespondentDisplaced)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * \text{1(RecruiterDisplaced)} $$

-   How could you motivate the chosen model?

  This model tells us the increase in odds of a displaced person being recruited if their recruiter is also displaced. This is helpful for the NGOs to know, so that they know howw to reach idSW for intervention. NGOs can make more informed decisions on whether they need to recruit more idSW as seeds. 

-   What quantities (parameters) in this model are key to answer your research question? How should they be interpreted?

This is the exact answer to our research question, on the most basic level. 

## Part 2

1.  Sub-team 1: show your work to Sub-team 2. Sub-team 2, comment:

-   Do you agree about the choice of sub-team 1?

-   How could you all improve the proposed visualization?

2.  Sub-team 2: show your work to Sub-team 1. Sub-team 1, comment:

-   Is there any difference between the model that was written down and the model you had in mind?

-   How could you all improve the motivation for the model and the interpretation?
